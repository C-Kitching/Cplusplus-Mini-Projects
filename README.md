# C-Mini-Projects
A series of miniature programming projects in C++ focused around object-orientated programming.  
Based on the OOP C++ course given at the University of Manchester.  
I sat this course myself in the 2019-2020 academic year.  
I have been a demonstrator for the course since the 2021-22 academic year.
