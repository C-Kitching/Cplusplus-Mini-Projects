# C-Mini-Projects
A series of miniature programming projects in C++ focused around object-orientated programming.  
Based on the OOP C++ course given at the University of Manchester.  
I sat this course myself in the 2019-2020 academic year.  
I have been a demonstrator for the course since the 2021-22 academic year.  

## Contents

1. **Photon energy calculator**  
Given an atomic number and the initial and final photon energy levels, determine the energy of an emitted photon in J or eV using the Bohr model. Program will validate all user input. 
2. **Statistics from data**  
Program to compute the mean, standard deviation and standard error of the mean electron charge. Data is read in from a file.  
3. **University courselist interface**  
Program reads in university courses from a data file.   
User is able to input an arbitrary amount of courses to add to the data set by providing a course code (as integer) and a title (as string).   
Stringstreams are then used to create a string containing all the info which are stored in vectors.   
Inputted courses are then printed out using an iterator.  
The user can also select a year and a sort method, courses will be printed out as specified.  
4. **A class for galaxies**  
Demonstration of classes in C++.  
Classifying galaxies with classification, redshift, total mass and stellar mass fraction.  
5. **A class for complex numbers**   
A demonstration of classes applied to complex numbers.  
6. **A class for matricies**

7. **A class for vectors**

8. **A class for shapes**
